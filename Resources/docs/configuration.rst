Configuration
=============

We must configure our Worker. Common definitions must be defined in
config.yml file, setting values for all installed Workers. Also we must
config gearman cache, using doctrine cache.

.. note:: If ``iterations`` value is 0, worker will not kill itself never, so
          thread will be alive as long as needed. The reason to allow workers
          to kill themselves is just to prevent each process to accumulate a
          large quantity of memory.

       # Each server must contain host and port
       # If annotations defined, will be full overwritten
       #
       # If servers empty, simple localhost server is defined by default
       # If port empty, 4730 is defined by default

In development mode you do not want to cache things over more than one
request. An easy solution for this is to use the array cache in the dev
environment ( Extracted from `DoctrineCacheBundle`_ documentation )
